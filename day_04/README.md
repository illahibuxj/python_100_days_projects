### 🧩 **Day 4: Multiplication Table Generator — Loops and Ranges**

**📝 Problem Description:**  
Ask the user for a number and print its multiplication table **up to 10**.  
Then, display the **sum of all results** in the table.  
Finally, ask the user if they want another table (Y/N) and continue until they say “N”.

**💡 Example:**
```

Input:
5

Output:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
...
5 x 10 = 50
Sum of all results = 275

```

**⚙️ Constraints:**
- Number must be greater than 0 and less than 100.

**🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. Use a `for` loop with `range()`.  
2. Multiply and print each line.  
3. Maintain a running total using a variable.  
4. Use a `while` loop for repeat functionality.

**💭 Hints:**
- Practice both `for` and `while` versions.  
- Try saving results in a list for later use.

**🎯 Concept Learned:**  
Loops, Range, Repetition, Accumulation
