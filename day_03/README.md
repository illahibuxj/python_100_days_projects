### 🧩 **Day 3: Student Grading System — Nested Conditions**

**📝 Problem Description:**  
Create a simple grading system.  
The program should take a student’s marks (0–100) and print their grade:
- 90–100 → A  
- 80–89 → B  
- 70–79 → C  
- 60–69 → D  
- Below 60 → F  

Also, if the marks are **above 90**, print `"Excellent!"`, if below 50, print `"Needs Improvement!"` and between 50 to 90 print `keep it up`.

**💡 Example:**
```

Input:
Marks: 85

Output:
Grade: B
Keep it up!

```

**⚙️ Constraints:**
- Marks must be between 0 and 100.

**🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. Take marks as integer input.  
2. Use nested `if-elif-else` structure.  
3. Include boundary conditions carefully (e.g., 89 vs 90).  
4. Add motivational message based on performance.

**💭 Hints:**
- Handle invalid inputs (negative or >100).  
- Use logical grouping (`and` operators).

**🎯 Concept Learned:**  
Nested Conditions, Ranges, Validation, Decision Making
