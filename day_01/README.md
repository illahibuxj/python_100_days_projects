## 🧩 **Day 1: Personal Info Formatter — Input, Output & String Handling**

**📝 Problem Description:**  
Create a program that asks the user for their **name**, **age**, and **city**, and then prints a **formatted introduction message**.  
After that, display how old the user will be **after 5 years**, and convert their name to **uppercase** and **title case**.

**💡 Example:**
```
Input:
Name: husnain
Age: 25
City: Larkana

Output:
Hello, husnain from Karachi! You are 25 years old.
After 5 years, you will be 30 years old.
Your name in uppercase: HUSNAIN
Your name in title case: Husnain

```

**⚙️ Constraints:**
- Age must be a positive integer.  
- Name and city must contain only alphabets.

**🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. Use `input()` to collect user data.  
2. Use `int()` to convert age for arithmetic operations.  
3. Use f-strings for formatted messages.  
4. Use string methods `.upper()` and `.title()`.

**💭 Hints:**
- Explore string methods: `.lower()`, `.capitalize()`, `.strip()`.  


**🎯 Concept Learned:**  
Variables, Input/Output, Type Conversion, String Methods, Basic Arithmetic
